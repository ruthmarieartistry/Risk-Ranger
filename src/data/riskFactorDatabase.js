  // PREGNANCY COMPLICATIONS
  postpartum_hemorrhage: {
    name: "Postpartum Hemorrhage",
    riskLevel: "HIGH",
    isStandalone: true,
    category: "Pregnancy Complications",
    education: {
      whatItIs: "An excessive loss of blood (more than 500ml for vaginal delivery or 1000ml for cesarean) following childbirth, which can be life-threatening.",
      whatCauses: "Uterine atony (failure of the uterus to contract), retained placenta, lacerations, or blood clotting disorders.",
      whyItMatters: "PPH indicates increased risk for the same complication in future pregnancies and may require emergency interventions. Clinics must ensure immediate access to blood products and surgical backup.",
      combinedRisk: "Severity of hemorrhage and number of units transfused directly influence future pregnancy risk. Recurrence risk increases with multiple episodes."
    }
  },

  preeclampsia: {
    name: "Preeclampsia",
    riskLevel: "HIGH",
    isStandalone: true,
    category: "Pregnancy Complications",
    education: {
      whatItIs: "A pregnancy complication characterized by high blood pressure and signs of damage to organ systems, most often the liver and kidneys, typically occurring after 20 weeks of pregnancy.",
      whatCauses: "Exact cause unknown, but involves abnormal placental development and blood vessel problems. Risk factors include first pregnancy, obesity, advanced maternal age, and chronic hypertension.",
      whyItMatters: "Preeclampsia can progress to life-threatening seizures (eclampsia) or organ damage. Women with history of preeclampsia have 15-25% recurrence risk in subsequent pregnancies and require intensive monitoring.",
      combinedRisk: "When combined with chronic hypertension, diabetes, or kidney disease, preeclampsia risk increases significantly and may necessitate automatic disqualification."
    }

  pregnancy_hypertension: {
    name: "Pregnancy-Induced Hypertension (PIH)",
    riskLevel: "MODERATE",
    isStandalone: false,
    category: "Pregnancy Complications",
    education: {
      whatItIs: "High blood pressure that develops during pregnancy (after 20 weeks) without protein in the urine or other signs of preeclampsia, and resolves after delivery.",
      whatCauses: "Similar to preeclampsia but less severe - involves vascular changes during pregnancy that affect blood pressure regulation.",
      whyItMatters: "While less severe than preeclampsia, PIH still requires careful monitoring and indicates cardiovascular stress during pregnancy. May progress to preeclampsia in 15-25% of cases.",
      combinedRisk: "Risk increases with obesity, multiple gestations, or pre-existing cardiovascular conditions. Can complicate labor and delivery planning."
    }
  },

  gestational_diabetes: {
    name: "Gestational Diabetes",
    riskLevel: "MODERATE",
    isStandalone: false,
    category: "Pregnancy Complications",
    education: {
      whatItIs: "High blood sugar levels that develop during pregnancy in women who didn't previously have diabetes, typically diagnosed between 24-28 weeks.",
      whatCauses: "Pregnancy hormones block insulin's action, causing glucose to build up in the blood. Risk factors include obesity, family history, and advanced maternal age.",
      whyItMatters: "Gestational diabetes increases risk of large babies, birth injuries, cesarean delivery, and can progress to Type 2 diabetes later. Requires careful glucose monitoring and may require insulin.",
      combinedRisk: "Combined with obesity or PCOS, recurrence risk is very high (up to 50-70%). May indicate underlying insulin resistance."

      whatItIs: "A condition where the placenta partially or completely covers the cervix, blocking the baby's exit path and causing bleeding risk.",
      whatCauses: "Abnormal implantation of the embryo, often associated with previous cesarean deliveries, uterine surgery, or multiparity.",
      whyItMatters: "Requires cesarean delivery and carries high risk of severe hemorrhage. Risk increases dramatically with previous cesarean (placenta accreta risk).",
      combinedRisk: "With prior cesarean sections, risk of placenta accreta (invasive placenta) increases exponentially - potentially life-threatening and requiring hysterectomy."

    name: "Placental Abruption",
    riskLevel: "HIGH",
    isStandalone: true,
    category: "Pregnancy Complications",
    education: {
      whatItIs: "The premature separation of the placenta from the uterine wall before delivery, cutting off oxygen and nutrients to the baby.",
      whatCauses: "Trauma, hypertension, smoking, cocaine use, or previous abruption. Often occurs suddenly and unpredictably.",
      whyItMatters: "Life-threatening emergency requiring immediate delivery. Can cause severe bleeding, fetal distress, and maternal shock. Recurrence risk is 10-15%.",
      combinedRisk: "Risk increases significantly with hypertension, smoking, or history of multiple abruptions. May indicate underlying vascular problems."

    education: {
      whatItIs: "Severe, persistent nausea and vomiting during pregnancy leading to weight loss, dehydration, and electrolyte imbalances requiring hospitalization.",
      whatCauses: "Related to pregnancy hormones (especially hCG), but exact cause unknown. More common with multiple gestations and molar pregnancies.",
      whyItMatters: "Can require IV fluids, hospitalization, PICC line placement, and TPN (total parenteral nutrition). Affects maternal nutrition and quality of life.",
      combinedRisk: "When requiring PICC line, TPN, or multiple hospitalizations, indicates severe case with high recurrence risk (up to 80%)."
    }

  preterm_labor: {
    name: "Preterm Labor",
    riskLevel: "MODERATE",
    isStandalone: false,
    category: "Pregnancy Complications",
    education: {
      whatItIs: "Labor that begins before 37 weeks of pregnancy, potentially leading to premature birth and associated complications.",
      whatCauses: "Infection, cervical insufficiency, multiple gestations, uterine abnormalities, or unknown causes.",
      whyItMatters: "Premature babies face respiratory, developmental, and health challenges. History of preterm labor increases recurrence risk to 15-30%.",
      combinedRisk: "With cervical insufficiency, short cervix, or previous very early preterm birth (<28 weeks), risk is substantially higher."

      whatCauses: "Essential hypertension (no known cause) or secondary to kidney disease, endocrine disorders, or vascular problems.",
      whyItMatters: "Dramatically increases risk of preeclampsia (25-50%), placental abruption, preterm birth, and fetal growth restriction. Requires medication management and intensive monitoring.",
      combinedRisk: "Combined with obesity, diabetes, or kidney disease, maternal and fetal risks become very high and may preclude safe surrogacy."
    }
  },

  diabetes: {
    name: "Diabetes (Type 1 or Type 2)",
    riskLevel: "HIGH",
    isStandalone: true,
    category: "Medical Conditions",

      whatItIs: "Pre-existing diabetes (Type 1 or Type 2) before pregnancy, requiring careful glucose management throughout pregnancy.",
      whatCauses: "Type 1: autoimmune destruction of insulin-producing cells. Type 2: insulin resistance, often related to obesity and genetics.",
      whyItMatters: "Increases risk of birth defects, preeclampsia, large babies, stillbirth, and neonatal complications. Requires intensive glucose monitoring and medication adjustment.",
      combinedRisk: "With poor glucose control (HbA1c >7%), obesity, or vascular complications, pregnancy risks are substantially elevated."

      whatCauses: "Autoimmune disorders (Hashimoto's, Graves'), iodine deficiency, or thyroid nodules/tumors.",
      whyItMatters: "Untreated thyroid disorders can affect fetal brain development and increase miscarriage risk. However, well-controlled thyroid disease with stable medication usually poses minimal risk.",
      combinedRisk: "Well-controlled thyroid disorder is generally low risk. Uncontrolled or requiring frequent medication adjustments is concerning."

      whatCauses: "Genetic predisposition combined with environmental triggers (allergens, smoke, cold air, exercise, stress).",
      whyItMatters: "Well-controlled asthma poses minimal risk. Poorly controlled asthma can lead to low oxygen levels affecting the baby, preterm birth, and preeclampsia.",
