## 🐛 If PDF Parsing Fails

Check browser console (F12) for errors:

**Common issues:**
1. PDF.js worker not loading → Check internet (uses CDN)
2. Corrupted PDF → Try different file
3. Browser compatibility → Use Chrome/Firefox

**Debug steps:**
```javascript
// Open browser console
// Upload a file
// Look for errors
// simplePdfParser.js logs all errors
```
