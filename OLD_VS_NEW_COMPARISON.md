# Risk Ranger: Old vs New Comparison

## What the Old App Had That the New App Is Missing

### 1. Clinical Narrative Generation
**Old App:**
- "Situation Summary" - AI-generated narrative overview of the candidate
- "Summary of Findings" - Contextual analysis of all factors combined
- "Condition Interaction & Significance" - Explains how conditions interact with each other
- "Clinic-by-Clinic Rationale" - Explains WHY each clinic type would view the case differently

**New App:**
- No narrative summaries
- No interaction analysis
- No clinic-specific rationales

**Example from old app:**
```
Situation Summary:
Sophia is a 35-year-old with a history of three pregnancies, two of which were full-term
but had complications including placental issues and postpartum hemorrhage. She also has
a history of fertility issues and a past adjustment disorder.

Condition Interaction & Significance:
Sophia's history of multiple pregnancy complications, specifically postpartum hemorrhage
(PPH) and placental issues, increases her risk in subsequent pregnancies as they could
indicate a propensity for surgical intervention and increased bleeding. The interaction
between her postpartum complications and a history of adjustment disorder suggests a
potential need for psychological support during future pregnancies.
```

### 2. Risk Factor Educational Content
**Old App:**
Each risk factor shows:
- Risk level badge (High/Moderate/Low)
- "Understanding This Factor" section with:
  - What it is
  - What causes it
  - Why it matters
  - Combined risk considerations
- [STANDALONE] marker for automatic disqualifiers

**New App:**
- Just lists the complication name
- No explanation of why it matters
- No educational content

**Example from old app:**
```
Postpartum Hemorrhage
High Risk
[STANDALONE]

Understanding This Factor:
What it is: An excessive loss of blood following childbirth which can be life-threatening.
What causes it: Occurs due to factors such as uterine atony, retained placenta, or lacerations.
Why it matters: Postpartum hemorrhage can lead to severe complications and requires careful
management in future pregnancies, which is of high concern to clinics.
Combined risk considerations: The degree of hemorrhage severity can influence management
plans and urgency of interventions during labor.
```

### 3. Clearance Assessment Display
**Old App:**
Shows qualitative badges:
- "Likely to Disqualify" (for strict clinics)
- "Requires Review" (for moderate clinics)
- "May Clear" or "Likely to Clear" (for lenient clinics)

**New App:**
Shows percentages:
- "0-19%: Very Unlikely"
- "20-39%: Unlikely"
- etc.

### 4. PDF Report Format
**Old App:**
- Includes all the narrative sections
- Shows risk factors with educational tooltips
- Has "Method & Reliability" disclosure
- More comprehensive clinical document

**New App:**
- Basic summary of data
- Color-coded acceptance odds
- Simple list of concerns
- No educational content

### 5. Risk Framework
**Old App (per their Method & Reliability page):**
- Multi-tiered: `Automatic Disqualifications`, `High Risk Flags`, `Moderate Risk Flags`
- AI-Assisted, Rule-Guided approach
- Conservative bias (more likely to flag for review)
- LLM generates clinical narratives following expert-defined rules

**New App:**
- Simple numeric penalties
- Purely deterministic
- No automatic disqualifiers vs. flags distinction
- No AI-generated narratives

## What the New App Does Better

1. **Fast deterministic parsing** - No API calls needed for simple cases
2. **Hybrid Claude approach** - Can handle complex medical records
3. **Multiple file upload** - Can process multiple documents at once
4. **Modern React UI** - Clean, responsive interface
5. **Transparent scoring** - Shows exact penalty calculations

## Recommendations for Improvement

### High Priority (Core Functionality):
1. **Add AI-generated clinical narratives** using Claude:
   - Situation Summary
   - Condition Interaction Analysis
   - Clinic-by-Clinic Rationale
   - Summary of Findings

2. **Add risk factor educational content**:
   - Create a database of risk factor explanations
   - Show "Understanding This Factor" tooltips
   - Mark standalone disqualifiers with [STANDALONE] badge

3. **Change clearance display** from percentages to qualitative badges:
   - "Likely to Disqualify"
   - "Requires Review"
   - "May Clear" / "Likely to Clear"

### Medium Priority:
4. **Add automatic disqualifier logic**:
   - Distinguish between "automatic disqualifications" and "flags for review"
   - Some factors should immediately result in "Likely to Disqualify"

5. **Improve PDF format**:
   - Include all narrative sections
   - Add educational content for each risk factor
   - Add Method & Reliability disclosure

### Low Priority:
6. **Add "Follow-up Question" feature** - Allow users to ask follow-up questions about the case
7. **Add dashboard** - Track reports created, records processed, recent activity
8. **Add report history** - Save and retrieve past assessments

## Technical Implementation Notes

The old app's approach:
```
1. User submits medical text
2. LLM parses the text (extracts structured data)
3. Rule engine evaluates the data (applies risk framework)
4. LLM generates narratives (situation summary, interactions, rationales)
5. Display results with educational tooltips
```

The new app's current approach:
```
1. User submits medical text or file
2. Deterministic parser OR Claude extracts data
3. Simple scoring calculates penalties
4. Display numeric results
```

What we need to add:
```
5. Use Claude to generate clinical narratives
6. Add risk factor database with educational content
7. Display results with narratives and tooltips
```
